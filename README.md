# fixcom
A webpage by Dre

This is a website I made for my final project. People can create requests, 
like dayaday todo's, so people with more free time can take care of them and get paid by doing so.

People can search for Requests to do if they have the time to. Login, Register is working with a database made in MySQL.

The project is made with Vue.JS and uses the JQuery Library, with the use os axios to handle the requests, as well as other
technologies in more especific uses.

DIST is the final files made after building.

FIXCOM is ALL the development code, only without the node-modules, which were too big to upload.
