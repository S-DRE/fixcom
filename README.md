# FixCom
_A webpage by Dre_

This is a website I made for my final project. People can create requests, 
like dayaday todo's, so people with more free time can take care of them and get paid by doing so.

People can search for Requests to do if they have the time to. Login, SignUp etc. are working with a MySQL database.

The project is made with `Vue.JS` and uses a bunch of libraries, with the use of axios to handle the requests, as well as other
technologies in more especific uses (like leaflet for mapping) and an example of API request.



The `DIST` folder contains the final files made after building.

The `FIXCOM` folder contains ALL the development code.
